# Build Process Guidelines

## Build Requirements
- Always build the project after completing any task
- Use the command: `npm run build`

## Build Workflow
1. Run the build command
2. If build succeeds:
   - Push changes with a suitable commit message
3. If build fails:
   - Fix the issues
   - Iterate the process until build succeeds

> **Note:** Never commit code that doesn't build successfully.
